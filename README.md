# 3-Digit-7-Segment-Display-Multiplexing

This project is about multiplexing a 3 digit 7 segment diplay using D1 mini. The code was written in Arduino IDE and circuit was built on breadboard using jumper cables. Alongside mini, I have used 74LS47 BCD to 7 segment driver IC and ULN2803 darlington transistor pair IC to select digits. Multiplexing works by switching each digit for a very small duration to create persistance of vision phenomenon.
