# 3-Digit-7-Segment-Display-Multiplexing

This project is about multiplexing a 3 digit 7 segment diplay using `D1 mini`. The code was written in `Arduino IDE` and circuit was built on `breadboard` using jumper cables. Alongside mini, I have used `74LS47 BCD to 7 segment driver` IC and `ULN2803 darlington transistor array` IC to select digits. Multiplexing works by switching each digit for a very small duration to create `persistance of vision` phenomenon.
